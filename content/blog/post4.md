## Learning Log

I've recently restarted my learning journey and decided to log my progress to stay more consistent.

- I began the **CS50 Web** course, submitted its project, and watched the next lecture.
- I also watched a bit of **Jadi's LPIC** series.
- I've decided to step away from tutorials and focus more on actually *doing* things.

I need to review and practice the web fundamentals like **HTML** and **CSS** again.  
I'll also use the roadmap from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) to guide me along the way.
